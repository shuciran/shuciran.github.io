### Text Classification
A RAG system usually works on top of an LLM, with additional documents, so it can answer user queries based on the content present inside the documents.

RAG systems work in the following way:

- The user asks a question.
- The question is then compared to the content of the documents present in the system.
- The most relevant documents are then used to answer the question.
