#### Remote File Inclusion bypassing .htaccess
If by any chance you are able to upload a file remotely within a server but you can't see the content due to a php restriction:
![[Pasted image 20220728233641.png]]Try by using another extension other than .php for example .phar or .phtml this will let you upload the file and it will be interpreted:
![[Pasted image 20220728233808.png]]

Remember to check where is the file uploaded, won't be always be within the assets folder.

Examples:
[ECHO CTF PCPrincipal Machine](https://echoctf.red/target/30)
