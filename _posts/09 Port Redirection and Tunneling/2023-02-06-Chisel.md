### Remote port forwarding
Chisel as client:
```powershell
# Single Port
.\\chisel.exe client 10.10.16.4:1337 R:1433:localhost:1433
# All the ports
./chisel client 10.10.14.3:1234 R:127.0.0.1:socks
```
Examples:
[[Anubis#^e12b6c]]

Chisel as server:
```bash
./chisel server --port 1337 --reverse
```
Examples:

### Forward SOCKS Proxy
Chisel as client:
```bash
./chisel.sh server -p 2345 --socks5
```
Chisel as server:
```bash
./chisel_1.7.7_linux_amd64 client 10.10.11.107:2345 <PROXY_PORT>:socks
```
Additionally /etc/proxychains.conf file needs to be setted as follows:
```bash
[ProxyList]
# add proxy here ...
# meanwile
# defaults set to "tor"
socks5  127.0.0.1 <PROXY_PORT>
```
Finally if this is an HTTP service we need to configure the foxyproxy with the port choosen:

### Double Pivoting

If there are two machines and we want to reach the second one fully with with double chisel, we need to upload a chisel and proceed to do the following commands:

1) On Kali Machine:
```bash
# For all the pivotings
./chisel server -p 1234 --reverse
```
> This server needs to be opened only once, and all the subsequent connections will be redirected towards this port.
{: .prompt-tip }

2) On first machine:
```powershell
# It needs to point to the Kali server:
./chisel client 10.10.14.3:1234 R:127.0.0.1:socks
```
> Since the port for the proxy is not specified, the socks proxy will be opened on port 1080 by default.
{: .prompt-tip }

3) On second machine:
```powershell
# It needs to point to the Kali server on different socks port:
./chisel client 10.10.14.3:1234 R:1081:socks
```
> For the second machine the second socks proxy port needs to be specified, it is worth mentioning that the traffic will be sent over the first tunnel.
{: .prompt-tip }

> It is also worth mentioning that further modification on the `/etc/proxychains.conf` file is needed, first of all `dynamic_chain` needs to be applied and `strict_chain` can't be in place so it needs to be commented. Moreover, the farthest proxychain needs to be put on top of the chain.
{: .prompt-warning }
```bash
## Proxychains.conf needs to be changed from strict_chain to dynamic_chain:
<SNIP>
# The option below identifies how the ProxyList is treated.
# only one option should be uncommented at time,
# otherwise the last appearing option will be accepted
#
dynamic_chain
#
# Dynamic - Each connection will be done via chained proxies
# all proxies chained in the order as they appear in the list
# at least one proxy must be online to play in chain
# (dead proxies are skipped)
# otherwise EINTR is returned to the app
#
#strict_chain
<SNIP>
#And also the first proxy needs to be in top of the ProxyList:
#
[ProxyList]
# add proxy here ...
# meanwile
# defaults set to "tor"
socks5  127.0.0.1 1081
socks5  127.0.0.1 1080
```
