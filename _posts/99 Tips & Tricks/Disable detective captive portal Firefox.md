Why does detectportal.firefox.com keep showing up in the proxy history? A _captive portal_ is a web page that serves as a sort of gateway page when attempting to browse the Internet. It is often displayed when accepting a user agreement or authenticating through a browser to a Wi-Fi network. To ignore this, simply enter about:config in the address bar. Firefox will present a warning but we can proceed by clicking "_I accept the risk!_". Finally, search for "network.captive-portal-service.enabled" and double click it to change the value to "false". This will prevent these messages from appearing in the proxy history.
