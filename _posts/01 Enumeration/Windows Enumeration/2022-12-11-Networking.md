#### System Network Configuration
```c
ipconfig /all
netstat -abno
arp -a
```

#### Enumerating Running Processes and Services
Keep in mind that this output does not list processes run by privileged users. On Windows-based systems, we'll need high privileges to gather this information, which makes the process more difficult.
```c
tasklist /SVC

Image Name                     PID Services
========================= ======== ============================================
...
lsass.exe                      564 KeyIso, Netlogon, 
```

#### Networking Routing Tables
```c
route print
```

#### View the active network connections
```c
netstat -ano
```

#### Firewall rules
```c
netsh advfirewall show currentprofile
netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name=all
```

#### Scheduled Tasks
```
schtasks /query /fo LIST /v
```

#### Active Endpoints
```cmd
for /L %i in (1,1,255) do @ping -n 1 -w 200 10.5.5.%i > nul && echo 10.5.5.%i is up.
```
