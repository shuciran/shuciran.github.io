### NMAP
Footprinting the Service
```bash
sudo nmap -p110,143,993,995 -sCV -Pn -n -vvv 10.129.95.171
```

### Connect to the IMAPS/POP3s service
```bash
openssl s_client -connect <FQDN/IP>:imaps	Connect to the IMAPS service.
openssl s_client -connect <FQDN/IP>:pop3s	Connect to the POP3s service.
```

### Authentication
Log in to the IMAPS service using cURL.
```bash
curl -k 'imaps://<FQDN/IP>' --user <user>:<password>	
```

### Retrieving a mail
Steps to interact with IMAPS inbox via openssl
1) Connect to the IMAP service via openssl:
```bash
openssl s_client -connect 10.129.95.171:993
CONNECTED(00000003)1
.........
<SNIP>
.........
read R BLOCK
* OK [CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 SASL-IR LOGIN-REFERRALS ID ENABLE IDLE LITERAL+ AUTH=PLAIN] HTB{roncfbw7iszerd7shni7jr2343zhrj}
```
2) Once connected we need to authenticate with `1 LOGIN <user> <pass>`
```bash
1 LOGIN robin robin
1 OK [CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 SASL-IR LOGIN-REFERRALS ID ENABLE IDLE SORT SORT=DISPLAY THREAD=REFERENCES THREAD=REFS THREAD=ORDEREDSUBJECT MULTIAPPEND URL-PARTIAL CATENATE UNSELECT CHILDREN NAMESPACE UIDPLUS LIST-EXTENDED I18NLEVEL=1 CONDSTORE QRESYNC ESEARCH ESORT SEARCHRES WITHIN CONTEXT=SEARCH LIST-STATUS BINARY MOVE SNIPPET=FUZZY PREVIEW=FUZZY LITERAL+ NOTIFY SPECIAL-USE] Logged in
```
3) Show namespaces
```bash   
n namespace
* NAMESPACE (("" ".")) NIL NIL
n OK Namespace completed (0.001 + 0.000 secs).
```
4) List the only namespace ("")
```bash
1 LIST "" *
* LIST (\Noselect \HasChildren) "." DEV
* LIST (\Noselect \HasChildren) "." DEV.DEPARTMENT
* LIST (\HasNoChildren) "." DEV.DEPARTMENT.INT
* LIST (\HasNoChildren) "." INBOX
1 OK List completed (0.001 + 0.000 secs).
```
5) Selecting one of the inboxes, in this case the ones with "HasNoChildren"
```bash
1 SELECT DEV.DEPARTMENT.INT
* FLAGS (\Answered \Flagged \Deleted \Seen \Draft)
* OK [PERMANENTFLAGS (\Answered \Flagged \Deleted \Seen \Draft \*)] Flags permitted.
* 1 EXISTS
* 0 RECENT
* OK [UIDVALIDITY 1636414279] UIDs valid
* OK [UIDNEXT 2] Predicted next UID
1 OK [READ-WRITE] Select completed (0.001 + 0.000 secs).
```
6) Now retrieving only the Subject with `f fetch 1:1 (BODY[HEADER.FIELDS (Subject)])` this 1:1 is because there is only `1 EXISTS` in the inbox if there was `4 EXISTS` the command should look like this `f fetch 1:4 (BODY[HEADER.FIELDS (Subject)])`
```bash 
f fetch 1:1 (BODY[HEADER.FIELDS (Subject)])
* 1 FETCH (BODY[HEADER.FIELDS (SUBJECT)] {17}
Subject: Flag

)
f OK Fetch completed (0.004 + 0.000 + 0.003 secs).
```
7) We can also search UNSEEN emails:
```bash
s search UNSEEN
* SEARCH
s OK Search completed (0.001 + 0.000 secs).
```
8) Finally to check the mails we can fetch the data with the email's number as follows `1 fetch 1 RFC822`
```bash
F1 fetch 1 RFC822
* 1 FETCH (RFC822 {167}
Subject: Flag
To: Robin <robin@inlanefreight.htb>
From: CTO <devadmin@inlanefreight.htb>
Date: Wed, 03 Nov 2021 16:13:27 +0200

HTB{983uzn8jmfgpd8jmof8c34n7zio}
)
F1 OK Fetch completed (0.001 + 0.000 secs).
```
