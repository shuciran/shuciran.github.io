The simplest option is to set the -maxtime option, which will halt the scan after the specified time limit:
```bash
nikto -host=http://www.megacorpone.com -maxtime=30s
```
Our second option is to tune the scan with the -T option. We can use this feature to control which types of tests we want to run:

#### Subdomain enumeration
```bash
nikto -mutate 5 -h <host>
```
