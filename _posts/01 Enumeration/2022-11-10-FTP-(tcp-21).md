#### Upload
To upload a file you need to go to the folder where the file is and ONLY use the file name otherwise you'll receive a 500 error:
```shell
passive # must be off
binary # to upload binaries, execute this command
put /path/to/file/<file_name> /<new_file_name>
```
Consider that for windows you may need the relative path.

#### Download
To download a file use the "get" command, if that doesn't work user the "binary" flag:
```shell
get <binary> <file_name>
```

Examples:
[ECHO CTF martin](https://echoctf.red/target/8/writeup/read/60)

#### Bruteforce 
```bash
hydra -L <user_file> -P <pass_file> <IP> ftp
nmap <IP> --script --ftp-brute --script-args userdb=/path/for/users -p 21
```
