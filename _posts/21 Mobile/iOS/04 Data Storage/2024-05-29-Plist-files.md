### Plist File

Plist files use an XML format and can be stored in plaintext ASCII or as a proprietary packed file format intended to reduce the file size. These binary files require the use of a supporting editing tool to view the file contents, such as the plutil command line utility on macOS/Linux/iOS or the plist Editor for Windows.

### Plist Editor (Windows)

You can download Windows [Plist Editor](http://www.icopybot.com/plist-editor.htm)
