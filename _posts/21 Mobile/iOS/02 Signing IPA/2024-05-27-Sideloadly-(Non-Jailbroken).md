For non-jailbroken devices, sideloadly can be used to sign and install IPAs. The application runs on Windows and macOS and requires the iOS device to be connected to the host via USB or Wi-Fi

It requires a free or paid Apple developer account to obtin a code signing certificate. Based on the type of developer account, Apple imposes certain restrictions:

* Apps signed with a free account are only valid for 7 days and only 3 sideloaded apps can be installed at a time on the same device.
* Apps signed with a paid account are valid for a year and there ar no limitations regarding the number o fsideloaded apps on the device.
