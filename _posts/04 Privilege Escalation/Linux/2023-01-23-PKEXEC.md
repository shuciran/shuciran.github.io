## PwnKit (ly4k)

This [PwnKit](https://github.com/ly4k/PwnKit) contains a pretty good PwnKit binary for PKEXEC. In order to exploit it, we need to download the PwnKit.c binary and compile from our Kali:

(This is to compile with x32 architecture if x64 is needed, delete "-m32")
```bash
gcc -m32 -shared PwnKit.c -o PwnKit -Wl,-e,entry -fPIC
```

Additionally, there is a compiled version of the binary with support for both architectures 32 and 64 bits.

Upload it to the victim machine and execute it, you can use your favorite ![Local Web Server](https://shuciran.github.io/posts/Local-Web-Server/)
