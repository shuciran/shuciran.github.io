### Identify the hash type
If you want to know the type of a password's hash you can run the following command on your machine:
```bash
hashcat.exe -j -m hash.txt
```
And it will throw the type:
```bash
Hash-mode was not specified with -m. Attempting to auto-detect hash mode.
The following mode was auto-detected as the only one matching your input hash:

400 | phpass | Generic KDF
```
Another resource to check hash types is on [Hashcat Documentation](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes)

### Dictionary Attack
Then you can execute a dictionary attack with rockyou.txt:
```cmd
hashcat.exe -m 400 -a 0 hash.txt rockyou.txt
```
