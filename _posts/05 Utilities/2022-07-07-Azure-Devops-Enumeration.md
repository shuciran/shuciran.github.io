**Azure DevOps Server** is a Microsoft product that provides version control, reporting, requirements management, project management (for both agile software development and waterfall teams), automated builds, testing and release management capabilities. It covers the entire application lifecycle, and enables DevOps capabilities. Azure DevOps can be used as a back-end to numerous integrated development environments (IDEs) but is tailored for Microsoft Visual Studio and Eclipse on all platforms.

This is a web-GUI tool and adding the captures here is unnecesary, for further details about how to use it, please refer to the examples.
