If we get a C# project not compiled, for example [SharpWSUS](https://github.com/nettitude/SharpWSUS) we can compile it with Visual Studio on a Windows machine, follow this steps:
1) Download the project onto your machine, you'll find a .sln file, click on it and Visual Studio will start automatically:
